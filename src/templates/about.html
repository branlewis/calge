        <p>Hello, I'm Brandon. I'm twenty-one years old and a member of the 5th cohort of CSIT members at CSUMB. While I did have prior experience working with python before this project, I had never before worked with the Django web framework. While there were some hurtles to overcome I found the project fun and my teammates great to work with. </p>

        <h2>Team Member</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Nathaniel Mauga. I’m twenty-four, male, and racially mixed with most parts Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Irish. This project has opened my eyes to the responsibility we have as software engineers to encourage equity amongst our communities. We have a unique position to be able to create and provide services and software to do this. After this project, I am especially driven to spread awareness of how technology can be used to support underrepresented minorities. I’m glad to have been a part of this project and to have been educated on the influence we can have on our communities.</p>
